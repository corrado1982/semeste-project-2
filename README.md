## Goal

To take the skills learned over the past three semesters and create an auction website.

## Brief


An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

## Requirements

- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
- A registered user may login
- A registered user may logout
- A registered user may update their avatar
- A registered user may view their total credit
